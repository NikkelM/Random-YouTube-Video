<!--Releasenotes end-->

## v1.5.2

- Added an option that allows you to reuse the same tab when shuffling multiple times from the same channel. This setting only takes effect if you have enabled the option to open shuffled videos in a new tab.
- Fixed a bug where it was possible for the database to not include some videos uploaded on a channel.

## v1.5.1

- Correctly migrate old channel settings to the new format.
- Small improvement to backend logic for channel settings.

## v1.5.0

- Added three new options to the popup: You can now choose to only shuffle from...
	- ...videos uploaded on or after a certain date.
	- ...videos uploaded on or after the day another video was uploaded.
	- ...the most recent x% of videos uploaded on the channel.
- Fixed a bug that might sometimes cause user settings to not get saved correctly.

## v1.4.6

- Fixed the "Shuffling..." text on the shuffle button not being reset after a shuffle.

## v1.4.5

- Added an additional threshold to prevent the API quotas to be used up by channels with too many uploads by accident.
- Added an alert for users of custom API keys when they are shuffling from a channel with 20,000+ uploads, as the YouTube API only provides the most recent 20,000 results.
- Added a small text change to the shuffle button to indicate the shuffle is working in case it takes a bit longer to fetch data from the database.
- Fixed some alignment issues in the extension popup.
- Removed unused code.

## v1.4.4

- Unfortunately, an attacker has compromised the default API keys provided by the extension. You can read the statement [here](https://github.com/NikkelM/Random-YouTube-Video/issues/125). These keys have therefore been disabled. You can still use your own custom API key, which is never transmitted to the extension's database and can therefore not be stolen. If you do not have a custom API key, you can generate one [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started). I will be working on reworking the way in which the extension communicates with YouTube's API to prevent this from happening again. I apologize for the inconvenience.
- Fixed a bug where the channel name displayed in the popup would sometimes not be synchronized with the one that is used in the backend.
- Fixed a bug where it would not be possible to set the shuffle percentage to 100% if another value was previously set.

## v1.4.3

- Fixed a bug occurring when a channel has no videos.

## v1.4.2

- The shuffle button will now show the current progress when more than one request to the YouTube API needs to be made.

- Some updates to the internal handling of API keys.
- Improved maintainability of the codebase.

## v1.3.0

- Limited the amount of daily requests a user may make to the YouTube API to protect the userbase against abuse. This should not affect users with normal usage patterns. If you are affected by this, you may make use of the custom API key option to remove this limitation.
