# What information does the app obtain and how is it used?
During normal usage, the app does not collect any personal information, and does not store any personal data in any form.

The app offers the option to sign up for a user account using third-party providers, such as, but not necessarily limited to, Google.
Choosing a third-party provider to sign up for an account is optional, and not required to use the basic functionality of the app.
When you sign up for an account using a third-party provider, the app collects and stores information provided by the third-party provider, such as, but not necessarily limited to, your name and email address.
All information that is shared by the third-party provider with the app is disclosed to you during the sign-up process.
The information collected is used to provide the functionality of the app, and for no other reason.

If you choose to subscribe to a paid plan, the app will collect and store payment information through Stripe, a third-party payment processor.
After payment concludes, the app will store information about your subscription, such as, but not necessarily limited to, the subscription plan and the subscription status, as well as identifiers to link this data to your payment identity with Stripe.
This data is collected with the sole purpose of identifying your subscription status, and subsequently providing you with the functionality of the app.
If you have any questions about the handling of your information during the payment process, please refer to Stripe's privacy policy.

# Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the app?

During this process, Stripe may collect and store information about your payment identity, such as, but not necessarily limited to, your name, email address, and payment information, such as credit card details.

# Data Retention Policy
Personal data collected by the app as described above is stored as long as you have an active account with the app.
If you choose to delete your user account, the app will delete personal data it collected.

Non-linkable data may be stored for longer amounts of time.

# Security
We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. 
We limit access to this information to authorized employees who need access to the information in order to operate, develop or improve the app. 
Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.
