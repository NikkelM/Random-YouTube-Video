Do you have a favourite YouTube channel, but don't know what to watch? This extension is for you!

The Random YouTube Video extension adds a 'Shuffle' button to YouTube channel and video pages, which will play a random video from the current channel. You can use the extension's popup to customize your experience further.

Highlighted Features:<br>
- If another user has already shuffled from the channel you want to watch, the extension will run faster for you as video IDs are shared!
- Choose from a wide range of options to individualize your experience, such as ignoring shorts, only shuffling from the most recent videos, shuffling multiple videos into a playlist, and much more!
- You don't need to open YouTube to shuffle from your favourite channels - the extension popup allows you to shuffle from your most recently visited channel at any time!
