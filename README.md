Do you have a favourite YouTube channel, but don't know what to watch? This extension is for you!

The Random YouTube Video extension adds a "Shuffle" button to YouTube channel and video pages, which will play a random video from the current channel. You can even choose what percentage of most recent videos should be considered when shuffling to exclude older videos!

Highlighted Features:<br>
- Sharing is caring: If another user has already shuffled from the channel you want to watch, the extension will run faster for you as video IDs are shared!
- Customize your experience: Choose from a wide range of options to individualize your experience, such as opening videos in a new tab or the channel's uploads playlist, and much more!
- Quick access: You don't need to open YouTube to shuffle from your favourite channels: The extension popup allows you to shuffle from your most recently visited channel at any time!
